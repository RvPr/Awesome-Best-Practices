Goals
========

To consolidate in one place, the best practices for software development.

To make each best-practice individually linkable, so it can be easily shared individually

Does not shy away from controversy. The most valuable best practices are often those which many people disagree with. The project does not aim to please everyone, and will take a stand even on those that haven't reached unanimous consensus.

Non-Goals
===========

This project is very opinionanted in deciding whom to trust, but not at all opinionated in terms of coming up with its own best practices.

Only entries that have already been championed by other credible authorities, will be included here

Format
========

Each entry shall follow the following format:

- One-liner guideline
- Paragraph length description of benefits from following said guideline
- External references to high-quality sources, that champion this guideline and provide more detail on why/when it is needed
  = Good sources: authors of best-selling software books. official blogs by leading software companies like Google. highly rated stack-exchange discussions
  = Bad sources: random bloggers
- Before-and-after examples

Terminology
===========

**Always/Never**: Guideline should be followed almost universally

**Prefer/Avoid**: Guideline is generally applicable, but there are many instances where it makes sense to set it aside

Contributions
=============

Pull requests welcome from all, as long as above guidelines are followed
