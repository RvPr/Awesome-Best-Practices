Governance and Processes
========================

This project is very opinionated in deciding whom to trust, but will not be pioneering any best practices of its own. Only entries that have already been championed by other credible authorities, will be included here.

This project does not shy away from controversy. The most valuable best practices are often those that are unpopular. Disagreements will be resolved in favor of champions who are most respected in the industry.

This project does not attempt to be a democracy. The project maintainers will exercise their best judgement, in the spirit of the project's goals and above tenets.

Format
========

All entries should [use the format laid out in this template](https://github.com/RvPr/Awesome-Best-Practices/blob/master/template.md).

Terminology
===========

**Always/Never**: Guideline should be followed almost universally

**Prefer/Avoid**: Guideline is generally applicable, but there are many instances where it makes sense to set it aside

**Design**: Anything that changes the behavior of the system 

**Coding**: Anything that doesn't have a functional impact, but changes the experience of reading/writing code. 

Contributions
=============
